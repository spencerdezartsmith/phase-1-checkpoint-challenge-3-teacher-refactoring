# Super Crazy Bonus Release

Edit this file to answer the following questions. Give examples. You may need to do a bit of research. :)

1. Why is Hash.fetch useful?
Hash.fetch is great because it can return you the value for a give key. You are also able to fetch the key and set a default value to it. If the key doesn't exist fetch will raise an error which can always be helpful.

2. What is the disadvantage of single inheritance, and what's a possible solution to that problem?

3. Why are these classes initialized with an options hash?
An options hash provides more flexibility to the initialize methods. It means that the parameters can be fed in any order which removes the chance of initializing with the wrong values of throwing errors. It also gave provided the initialize method the option of setting default values which meant that not every instance had to be initialized with every piece of required information.

4. What is the purpose of the private keyword in a class? What does it protect you from and why is that valuable?

5. Why are concepts like encapsulation, single responsibility, and abstraction important? Now that you've been programming for a while, have you seen any advantages for yourself, or can you imagine them in the future?
